## Setup API Keys

API keys available free of charge. Sign up required for Tiingo API and Fred API:

- https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/
- https://www.tiingo.com/
- https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/edgar-application-programming-interfaces (No sign up or API key required for EDGAR API. Users will be prompted for a "User Agent" during the setup wizard.)

IMPORTANT: Read "Legal / Attribution" before using Qemy with any 3rd party API service.

- Refer to "Usage" below for info related to API usage and data limitations.

API key setup wizard included. Run the CLI to receive a prompt.

Or manually create a .env file in project root directory and add API keys like this:

```env
TIINGO_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
FRED_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
EDGAR_USER_AGENT=<your user agent> # EDGAR_USER_AGENT=john johndoe@example.com
```

Make sure .env is included in .gitignore to keep your keys secure.

## Optional: Setup Launch Script

- Recommended for convenience if you are working with the source code directly.

### Set path to your venv in the bash script

From the project root directory, find the qemy bash script and open with a text editor:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

orig_dir=$(pwd)
source ~/path/to/qemyenv/bin/activate # make sure this matches your venv activate path
# Conda users: change above line to "conda activate qemyenv"
cd ~/path/to/qemy # match with your project root directory
python -m frontend.cli
deactivate 
# Conda users: change above line to "conda deactivate"
cd "$orig_dir"
```

### Turn qemy script into an executable

Also from project root directory:

```bash
chmod +x qemy
```

### Create Path in .bashrc

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following to the bottom of your .bashrc. Replace "path/to/your/project/root" with your own: 

```bash
# PATH for Qemy
export PATH="$HOME/path/to/your/project/root:$PATH"
```

---

## Usage

- If you setup the optional launch script, you can simply run: 

```bash
qemy
```

from any bash terminal session.

- Alternatively, run the CLI manually with:

```bash
source ~/path/to/qemyenv/bin/activate
# Conda users: change above line to "conda activate qemyenv"
cd ~/path/to/qemy # path to project root directory
python -m frontend.cli
```

- This program does not require paying any fees or subscriptions. There are paid subscriptions for Tiingo API available in order to increase data usage limitation. Be mindful data usage/request limits for all APIs. More info and tracking is available on their websites.
