# Development Log

## Known Issues:

- [ ] (Non-critical) Parsing logic for company concepts data should factor in more variations of XBRL taxonomy.
- [ ] (Non-critical) Parsing logic for Total Debt metric should combine components of long and short-term debt on certain edge-cases. 
- [ ] (Non-critical) Need a utility function that distinguishes between cumulative, quarterly and yearly values for metrics in SEC filings.

## Ideas:

- Stock screening and filtering.
- Separate filing commands: 'Income Statement', 'Balance Sheet', 'Cash Flow Statement' 
- IFRS filing support and currency conversion. 
- Data preprocessing and normalizing.

### Note (2025-06-03):

- This is my first serious project on GitHub. Earlier commits show my learning curve with git, and workflow habits. Since then, I've been refining my process. - Thanks for understanding.

### Note (2025-06-24):

- Now that the road-map for v0.1.0 is almost completed, and most of the core design decisions have been settled, Qemy is now officially out of its prototyping stage. Changes or overhauls to the user CLI or developer facing SDK will begin to be tracked in a change-log after the v0.1.0 release.
