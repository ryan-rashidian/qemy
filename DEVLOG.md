- This is my first serious project on GitHub. Earlier commits show my learning curve with git, and workflow habits. Since then, I've been refining my process. - Thanks for understanding.

### Note (2025-08-17) - [@ryan-rashidian](https://github.com/ryan-rashidian):

- Though progress has slowed in recent weeks, my intention is to continue development on Qemy into the foreseeable future. This project will continue to be shaped, refined, and refactored as I become a better developer. In the mean time, I'm keeping things simple, focusing on fundamentals, and not digging any deep holes early. I don't want to fall into any perfectionist trap, or constantly change the scope of project goals. - But it may still take a few more months of 'sandbox' testing before anything resembling a user-ended application comes out.
