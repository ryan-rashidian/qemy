# Ideas:

- CLI Graphing and data visualization (I want to avoid just plugging in popular GUI based libraries, and keep everything in the terminal window. Qemy will become easily extended from its base using the planned plugin system, or simply be used as the financial/economic data source in a pipeline for research, ML, etc..)
